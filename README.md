TRIVIA: Theseus was Ariadne's husband. Ariadne helped him navigate a maze where a minotaur (half man, half bull) ate people. The king demanded sacrifices of children every 9 years to satisfy the hunger of the bull. Theseus, with the help of Ariadne, killed the bull and ran off with Ariadne. Dionysus, the god of wine, fell in love with her and carried her away to become a goddess. Now Theseus will return the favor and help with plugin developement.
